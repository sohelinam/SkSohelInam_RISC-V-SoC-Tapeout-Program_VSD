Synthesizer
Tool used for converting the RTL to netlist
Yosys is the synthesizer used in this course

NETLIST
            =====> iverilog=======> vcd file ----->gtkwave (should be same as output observed during RTL simulation)
TESTBENCH

The set of primary inputs /  primary outputs will remain same between the RTL design and the sythesized netlist ===> same testbench can be used.

RTL design
-RTL design
 --Behavioural representation of the required speicification

input clk, rst, 
output result, done);

Synthesis

-RTL to Gate level
translation

-The design is converted into gates and the connections are made between
--This is given out as a file called netlist

What is .lib

.lib
-collection of logical modules.
-includes basic gates like And, Or, Not etc.
-Different flavors of the same gate
-2 input And gate
-Slow
-Medium
-Fast

-3 input And gate
-Slow
-Medium
-Fast

-4 input And gate

Why do we need different flavours of gate

- Combinational delay in logic path determines the maximum speed of operation of logic circuit
-So we need cells that work fast toTcomi small
`Are faster cells sufficient?

Tclk > Tcq_q + Tcombi + Tsetup_b


Why do we need slow cells?

-To ensure there are no "HOLD" issues at DFF_B , we need cells work slowly
-Hence we need cells that work fast to meet the required performance and we need cells that work slow to meet HOLD
-The collection forms the .lib

Faster Cells vs Slower Cells
-Load in Digital Logic circuit -> Capacitance
-Faster the charging / discharging of capacitance -> Lesser the cell delay

---To charge/discharge the capacitance fast, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current
---Wider transistors -> Low delay -> More area and power as well!!
---Narrow transistors-> More Dely -> Less area and Power
---Faster cells do not come free, they come at penality of area and power.

Selection of cells

-Need to guide the synthesizer to select the flavor of ceells that is optimum for the implementation of logiv circuit
-More use of faster cells
--Bad cicruit in terms of power and area
---Hold time violations

-More use of slower cells
--Sluggish circuit, may not meet the performance need
- The guidance offered to the sythesizer --> "Constraints"
